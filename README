Connect X

Jace Rinder

Overview:
 This project is new rendition of the classic game of Connect 4 that employs a variety of new features such as memory efficiency, game optimizations,
 configurable dimensions for the gameboard, configurable win conditions, and also allows for more than 2 players to compete.

How to use:
 First it is important to have the files arranged such that the makefile and a folder named 'connectX' are in a local directory together.
 After this is set up, the user can compile the project using 'make.' To run the project, the user can enter 'make run.' And to remove an
 executable, the user can enter 'make clean.' Once the program has been run, the user will be prompted to configure the optional features of
 the game. After the user finishes designing their style of game, the board will be updated on the command line as each player makes a move.
